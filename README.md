# Sawery Maxer Secure Protocol (SMSP)

**Sawery Maxer Secure Protocol (SMSP)** is a straightforward and secure communication protocol designed for HTTP/HTTPS to ensure encrypted data exchange and data integrity. SMSP uses a `Security ID` for session identification and a defined header format for secure data transmission, making it an effective solution for short-term and long-term secure communications.

## Key Features

- **Secure Communication:** SMSP ensures encrypted data transfer over HTTP/HTTPS for confidential and secure exchanges.
- **Session Identification:** Utilizes a `Security ID` to identify and manage protocol sessions.
- **Defined Header Format:** Includes a standard header format for structured and reliable data transmission.
- **Easy Implementation:** Designed to be simple and quick to implement in various applications.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization:** The client and server exchange HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses with the SMSP protocol header.
2. **Verification:** The `## SMSP PROTOCOL ##` header and the `Security ID` are checked for validity.
3. **Data Exchange:** Encrypted data is exchanged using the defined protocol format to ensure data integrity and authenticity.

## Example Header

Here is an example of what the SMSP protocol header might look like:

```plaintext
## SMSP PROTOCOL ##
Security ID = (1)
