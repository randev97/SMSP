# Sawery Maxer Secure Protocol (SMSP)

**Sawery Maxer Secure Protocol (SMSP)** is a secure and easy-to-implement communication protocol designed for HTTP/HTTPS that provides encrypted data exchange and ensures data integrity through a `Date Key` updated every 3 months. This protocol includes a `Security ID` for session identification and uses a defined header format for secure data transmission.

## Key Features

- **Secure Communication:** SMSP ensures encrypted data transfer over HTTP/HTTPS for confidential and secure exchanges.
- **Date Key Renewal:** The `Date Key` is updated every 3 months to enhance long-term security.
- **Session Identification:** Utilizes a `Security ID` to identify and manage protocol sessions.
- **Defined Header Format:** Includes a standard header format for structured and reliable data transmission.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization:** The client and server exchange HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses with the SMSP protocol header.
2. **Verification:** The presence of the `## SMSP PROTOCOL ##` header and the validity of the `Security ID` and `Date Key` are checked.
3. **Data Exchange:** Secure data transmission occurs using the `Date Key` to ensure data integrity and authenticity.
4. **Key Management:** The `Date Key` is renewed every 3 months for ongoing security.

## Example Header
